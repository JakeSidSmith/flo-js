# Flo-js v 0.0.0

__Animation library for use with HTML5 canvas__

## Setup

### Installation

1. Use bower to import flo-js into your project, or manually download and copy flo.js to your desired location.

        bower install flo-js#1.0.0 -S

    I'd recommend pinning to a specific version and using `-S` to add this to your bower.json automatically.

2. Link to flo.js in your main HTML / template file.

        <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/flo-js/flo.js"></script>

    Replace `bower_components/flo-js/flo.js` with the appropriate link to flo.js.
